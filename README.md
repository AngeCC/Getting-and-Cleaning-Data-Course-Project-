# README file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

The Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project repository on Github contains all files required for this course project. 
This README.md file included in this repository explains how the script works and how the files are connected.
The Codebook.md file describes the variables, the data and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data and produce the data file tidydata.txt for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 

## Project Background

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained, [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


The data used in this project comes from the following link

## Project Requirements

The requirements for the project are to create one R script run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviations for each measurement
3. Uses Descriptive actvity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject
